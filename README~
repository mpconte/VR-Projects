Some useful (?) source code for the VR course.

3ds - source for a library that understands 3ds models. You should not have to look
      at this (or copy it anywhere) but it is here for your information.  The only
      critical issue is that it only understands ppm imagery (not jpeg!) and 
      that such imagery needs to be square where the width is a power of 2

vesample - a very simple ve program that loads 3ds models and lets you 
      manipulate them.  See the README file in the directory.

vem - a simple 'walk around the environment' library for ve

wingman - a stub for playing with a usb device

vr-auto-show - vr application for a virtual auto show where users can interact with a room full of various cars
