    This is the new audio interface for VE.  This is not compatible
    with 2.1 and earlier audio interfaces although some constants
    and types are re-used.  From an application layer the new interface
    is somewhat simpler.  The physical arrangement of outputs is
    abstracted and dealt with in the environment file.

<p class="cdoc-item">
<a name="sect_0"></a><h2 class="tag-section">Overview</h2>
    
    This is how VE models audio.
    <p>
    From the application point-of-view there are 0 or more audio channels.
    An audio channel represents a logical grouping of audio outputs.  For
    example, a set of loudspeakers that provide environmental sound may
    be a separate channel from a pair of headphones that provide personal
    sound.  Channels are identified by names.
    <p>
    The name "default" is always defined as the "default" audio channel
    for a given setup.  All channels can be accessed - i.e. if a program
    asks the library for a channel object for any channel name, a valid
    object will be returned.  However, that object may just be a pointer
    to a "null" channel which generates no output.
    <p>
v    A channel has 0 or more outputs.  If channels are on the same node,
    they may share outputs (e.g. the same output may be referenced by
    more than one channel).  Outputs also have location and orientation
    information associated with them as a <em>frame</em>, allowing the
    specification of a physical arrangement of speakers.
    <p>
    Sounds sent to a channel are rendered via an <em>engine</em>.  
    Audio rendering engines can be loaded at run-time as device drivers.
    Engines are responsible for generating positional audio as well as 
    delivering output to audio <em>devices</em>.  Delivery is left up to
    the engine layer to allow for the use of hardware-based positional audio
    (e.g. DirectX technologies).
 
<p class="cdoc-item">
    Multiple audio drivers may be used at once.  This is the operating system
    interface.  An audio device may have multiple audio outputs.  These
    outputs must be sequentially numbered starting from 0 up to <i>n</i>-1
    where <i>n</i> is the number of individual outputs the device supports.
    A device may optionally map names to these outputs.  In particular, the
    <code>veAudioDevGetOutput()</code> call must always recognize integer
    values for outputs and may optionally recognize names.
    <p>The only driver guaranteed
    to be available is the "null" driver which is nothing more than
    a sink.  It does not generate any actual output.</p>

    Audio is combined together into streams appropriate for sending to
    hardware by an engine.  For both development and research purposes
    the interface to the engine is specified so that the engine can
    be loaded as a module at run-time.  To this end, the engine
    must be prepared to provide the functions in the
    <code>VeAudioEngine</code> structure.
    <p>For audio engines that are built as a module, they should
    provide an interface of type "aengine" (see the 
    <a href="ve_driver.h.html">ve_driver</a> module for more information
    on how to write drivers and specify what they "provide").
    <p>Note that the name "default" is reserved to mean the first

    "mix" engine (which mixes all output channels equally).

    Any audio output is ultimately delivered to a device, which is the
    interface to the actual hardware.  Audio devices come in two
    varieties.  Normal devices are simply audio sinks in that, any
    code could send frames to the device's output.  Pseudo-devices are
    those that are just placeholders which allow specification and
    control of an audio-rendering platform's built-in device support.
    For example, if an audio renderer were built around OpenAL, then
    typically the OpenAL layer would be responsible for delivering
    frames to the audio devices - that is, the engine is tightly
    coupled to the audio devices.  In these cases, it is not necessary
    for the VeAudioDevice object to be able to receive data from a VE
    application.
    <p>A special device called "default" always exists at the
    initialization of any VE application.  This device uses the "null"
    driver, meaning that it does not generate any real audio output,
    but instead silently discards any frames given to it.
    This default device can be overridden at run-time by defining
    a real device with the name "default".  In fact, it is expected
    that the VE initialization scripts will contain a series of
    optional devices called "default" in order of increasing
    preference, so that, if one exists, then it will stick.  If one

    The following isn't necessary to know in order to use the 
    application interface, but it is necessary to understand
    the data structures.
    Sounds are loaded into memory and then adjusted to the
    internal sampling frequency and sample format.  In the
    time-domain a sound is broken down into frames.  A frame
    is the unit on which processing is done.  A new instance
    of a sound may only be created on the boundary of a frame.
    A frame is some fixed number of samples.  Any sound that
    is not an even number of frames is padded with silence to
    make a round number of frames.  This does not typically need
    to known at the application layer - the library hides these
    details.
    <p>
    The frame size can only be set before initialization time.
    (see <code>veAudioSetFrameSize()</code>).  The frame size is determined
    by either the <code>-ve_opt audio_frame</code> command-line
    option or the <code>VE_AUDIO_FRAME</code> environment variable.
    If both are specified, then the command-line option takes
    precedence.  If neither are specified a built-in default value
    is used (see <code>veAudioGetFrameSize()</code>).
    Similarly, the sampling frequency at which processing is done
    faces similar restrictions (see <code>veAudioSetSampFreq()</code>).
    <p>
    Internally the library uses a floating-point representation
    of sound intensity.  That is, a single sample is represented
    by a float.  All sounds are processed as though they were 
    mono.  Stereo sound files are downmixed to audio when they
    are loaded.

<a name="sect_3"></a><h2 class="tag-section">Instances</h2>

    Each sound is played by creating an <i>instance</i> of it.
    This instance has a set of <i>parameters</i> associated with it.
    (See the <code>VeAudioParams</code> structure below for details on
    available parameters.)  Once created, an application may:
    <ul>
    <li>change paramters of an instance while it plays</li>
    <li>request early termination of playback of an instance</li>
    <li>test to see if an instance has stopped playing</li>
    <li>wait for an instance to stop playing</li>
    </ul>
    Most audio rendering engines will have a limit on the number of
    instances that can play simultaneously.  Even if it finishes
    playing, an instance persists in the engine until it is 
    "cleaned" by the application.  By "cleaning" an instance, the
    application is relinquishing the slot and can no longer modify
    or query that instance.  Thus it is possible to clean an instance
    before it finishes playing, and the engine will automatically
    dispose of its resources as soon as it finishes - however, in
    this scenario, it would be impossible for the application to
    wait on or check the status of the instance.
    <p>Instances are represented to the application by an identifier
    of type <code>int</code>.</p>

    actually sending output to the audio devices, but all processing
    progresses as it would otherwise.  Some devices may implement this
    as sending "0" data to audio devices to maintain synchronization.
