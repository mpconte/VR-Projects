These demos are a mix of demos ported from GLUT and other sources and
some that were written especially for the virtual environment.  In
general these programs should not be distributed outside the lab - most
of the code is freely distributable, but unless somebody wants to audit
the code, textures and sounds for such a purpose, its best to keep them
local.

These programs have all been updated for v2.0 of the VE library.
