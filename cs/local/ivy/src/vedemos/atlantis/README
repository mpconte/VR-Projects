Requirements/Controllers:  None

A port of the OpenGL Atlantis demo.  The difference here is that
after about 30 seconds, the sharks begin to swarm towards the user.
This was a quick hack and lots of things can be fixed.

ESC exits.

To do:
- head-tracker support is missing
- whales and dolphin appear to be having spasms
- bad clipping when sharks get close.  It would be good to have
  them swim around a larger radius surrounding the user (but not
  actually running into the user)
