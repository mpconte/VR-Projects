Requirements/Controllers:  None

This is a port of the "rollercoaster" demo from the glut-3.7 distribution.
The rollercoaster runs a little quickly and there is a pause early in the
animation.  If someone wants to grok the animation code I'm sure it can
be fixed.  Some of the symbol names are in German so occasionally it is
unclear for non-German-speaking people.
