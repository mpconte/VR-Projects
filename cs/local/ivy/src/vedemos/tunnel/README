Requirements/Controllers:  None

An updated version of a demo I wrote long ago under IRIS GL.  The program
builds a random tunnel and flies the user down the center along a spline.
Nicknamed the "Psychedelic Intestine".  A neat (if disgusting) project
would be to get flesh-like textures for the walls.  The tunnel is very
long, but finite, so the demo should eventually end.  I've never sat
through it long enough to see the end (nothing special happens there
anyways).

Command-line options:
-ve_opt texture <ppmfile>
	Specifies an alternate ppm (P6) file to use as the texture.
-ve_opt draw_stats (0|1)
	If the argument is 1 then statistics will be drawn in the
	lower-left of every window.
-ve_opt draw_axes (0|1)
	If the argument is 1, then the axes at each node of the tunnel
	will be drawn.  More for debugging than visual interest.
-ve_opt fog (0|1)
	If 1, then black fog will be used to obscure the distant end of
	the tunnel.  This is more effective in the long straight-aways
	as you can't see the new sections being added on to the tunnel.
