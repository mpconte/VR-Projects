% (velocity|acceleration) (real|simulated) motion flickering? dist is-vis?

% where the trial is either a constant velocity or constant acceleration

% trial, runs either with input from the trike encoders or is simulated.

% motion is either acceleration or velocity (in m/s/s or m/s) for simulated

% conditions, flickering? is either 1 or 0 indicated that the walls flicker

% (or not), dist is the distance (in m) to the target, and is-vis? is

% either 1 or 0 indicating that the target always remains visible.

%

% as this is a demo input, is-vis is always true

velocity simulated 1.0 1 10.0 1

acceleration simulated 0.5 0 20.0 1

velocity real 2.0 1 5.0 0
