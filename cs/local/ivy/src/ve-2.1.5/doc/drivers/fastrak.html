<h1>VE - Drivers</h1>
<h1>fastrak</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The fastrak driver supports trackers that use the Polhemus
Fastrak protocol for communicating over a serial line.
This includes the InterSense IS-900 tracker.

<h2>Devices</h2>

<h3>fastrak</h3>

<p>The fastrak device type generates the same standard pos/quat
elements as do other head-tracker drivers.</p>

<p><b>Elements</b></p>

<dl>
<dt><b>pos</b> [vector:3]</dt>
<dd>Describes the position of the tracker in 3-dimensional
Cartesian space (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>).  This position
is relative to the origin of the tracker.</dd>

<dt><b>quat</b> [vector:4]</dt>
<dd>Describes the orientation of the tracker as a quaternion.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Options</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>line</b></dt>
<dd>The name of the serial line device.  On Unix systems, this
is typically a name <em>beginning</em> with "/dev/tty" (e.g.
on Linux, "/dev/ttyS0" is the first serial port).  This option
must be specified in the device description.</dd>

<dt><b>speed</b></dt>
<dd>The speed at which the serial line should be run.  If not
specified, this value defaults to "9600".</dd>

<dt><b>flow</b></dt>
<dd>The flow control settings that should be used in communication.
Possible values are:
<ul>
<li><b>xonxoff</b> - use XON/XOFF characters for flow control.</li>
<li><b>rtscts</b> - use hardware flow control (RTS/CTS lines).
This will require an appropriately wired cable between the tracker
and the serial port.</li>
<li><b>none</b> - do not use flow control.</li>
</ul>
If this value is not specified then the default is "none".
</dd>

<dt><b>station</b></dt>
<dd>The stations to activate.  Only those stations mentioned in this
option will be enabled and reported.
</dd>

<dt><b>info</b></dt>
<dd>If this option is present and its value is a non-zero integer,
then version information about the tracker will be queried and displayed
at startup.  If not specified (or if specified with the value 0) then
no such information is displayed.  For debugging/curiosity purposes only.
</dd>

<dt><b>pos_epsilon</b></dt>
<dd>Simple gating value for position information.  
If specified then changes will only be
reported once one of the dimensions of the position has changed by this
amount.  e.g. if the value of this option is set to '0.01' then a new
position read from the tracker will not be passed to the application unless
there is a change of at least 0.01 in at least one its dimensions.
If not specified the default value is 0.0 (i.e. no gating).
</dd>

<dt><b>quat_epsilon</b></dt>
<dd>Simple gating value for quaternions.  
If specified then changes will only be
reported once one of the dimensions of the quaternion has changed by this
amount.  e.g. if the value of this option is set to '0.01' then a new
quaternion read from the tracker will not be passed to the application unless
there is a change of at least 0.01 in at least one its dimensions.
If not specified the default value is 0.0 (i.e. no gating).
</dd>

<dt><b>refang</b></dt>
<dd>A set of boresight reference angles in the form:
<blockquote>
<i>yaw</i>,<i>pitch</i>,<i>roll</i>
</blockquote>
If this is specified then these will be used to boresight
the stations.  Note currently only one set of reference angles
may be specified which will be applied to all stations.
</dd>

<dt><b>led</b></dt>
<dd>Allows the LEDs on an InterSense tracking unit to be
turned on ("1") or off ("0") by the driver when it initializes.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Using the Driver</h2>

<p>Driver name: <code>fastrakdrv.so</code></p>
<p>Example:
<pre>
    driver device fastrak fastrakdrv.so
    device is900 fastrak {
        line /dev/ttyS0
        speed 115200
        flow none
        info 0
        station 1
    }
</pre>
