<p>
    This header file contains internal structures for the library.
    In general, these structures should not be accessed by applications.
    There are however, some macros in this header which can help in
    tuning performance of the library.  Some platforms may choose to
    ignore these parameters if they do not use the generic library mixers
    (e.g. if they are using hardware mixers).
    If these parameters are changed than the library and programs dependent
    upon the library will need to be recompiled for them to take effect.
    The following parameters are the important ones:
<dl>
<dt><b>VE_AUDIO_MAX_INST</b></dt>
<dd>The number of instances that can be played simultaneously.  More
instances will require more memory and more computing time to mix.
</dd>
<dt><b>VE_AUDIO_FREQ</b></dt>
<dd>The frequency at which samples are played back, expressed as an integer
in Hz.  Be careful adjusting this parameter unless you are positive that
the value you are setting is supported on your platform.  A higher frequency
requires more processing time and memory but provides better quality output.
</dd>
<dt><b>VE_AUDIO_FRAME_LENGTH</b></dt>
<dd>The block-size that the mixer will use in sample units.  The
playback thread tries to stay one block ahead to avoid drop-outs.  This
means that the maximum latency of the system is roughly twice the frame
length divided by the sample frequency.  For example, if the frame length
is 500 samples, and the frequency is 44100 Hz, then the worst case latency
for witnessing the effect of a change to an instance, is about 226 ms.
Adjusting the frame length is tricky - changing the frame length does not
generally affect the overall computing time required for the mixer (the
same number of samples get mixed no matter what) unless you go to an
extremely small frame length (i.e. where the overhead of a call to the
mixer becomes significant compared to the mixer work itself).  Smaller
frame lengths provide better latency for audio, but require more frequent
interrupts by the thread.  Systems with other large tasks or frequent
high-priority tasks may benefit from a larger frame length.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some of these parameters should admittedly be adjustable at run-time
rather than compilation-time.  This will be addressed in a future revision.
