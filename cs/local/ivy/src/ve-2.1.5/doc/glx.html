<h1>VE GLX Implementation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This library implements the VE model on top of GLX.  GLX is an interface
between the X window system and OpenGL (thus it is also an implementation
on top of OpenGL).  This implementation requires a platform that supports
GLX, OpenGL, and pthreads, preferrably at the kernel level.  The X library
must be X11R6 or later or any X library that supports thread-safe operation
via the <code>XInitThreads()</code> call.
</p>

<h2>Environment Options</h2>
<p>The following environment options are supported by the GLX layer:
<dl>
<dt><b>doublebuffer</b></dt>
<dd>If set to a non-zero integer, then a double-buffered window will
be created.  Otherwise a single-buffered window will be created.
<dt><b>red</b></dt>
<dt><b>green</b></dt>
<dt><b>blue</b></dt>
<dd>The number of bits of red, green and blue to request in the frame buffer.
Default is system dependent.</dd>
<dt><b>alpha</b></dt>
<dd>The number of bits of alpha buffer to request.  Default is 0
(i.e. no alpha buffer requested).  This option should generally be
set by the application.</dd>
<dt><b>depth</b></dt>
<dd>The number of bits of depth buffer to request.  Default is 0
(i.e. no depth buffer requested).  This option should generally be
set by the application.</dd>
<dt><b>stereo</b></dt>
<dd>If set to non-zero then a stereo window will be created for all
windows to which this applies.  If zero, then a mono window will be
created for all windows to which this applies.</dd>
<dt><b>noborder</b></dt>
<dd>If set to a non-zero integer then VE will attempt to prevent the
window manager from decorating the window, thus providing a window with
no border.  For most windows being rendered onto immersive displays
(e.g. caves, head-mounted displays) you do not want window decorations.
This will only work with window managers that respect Motif window
manager hints (e.g. mwm, 4Dwm).</dd>
<dt><b>glx_no_threads</b></dt>
<dt><b>glx_no_pipe_threads</b></dt>
<dd>The default in the GLX layer is spawn one thread per X display (i.e.
pipe).  These options allow the thread creation to be changed.  If the
option "glx_no_threads" is defined and is some integer other than 0 then
no threads will be spawned regardless of the number of pipes.  Otherwise,
if the option "glx_no_pipe_threads" is defined and is some integer other
than 0 then a thread will be created per window rather than per pipe.
On many systems this is no faster than one thread per pipe and on some
systems it may be slower due to GLX context switching.  These options
are for debugging and should generally not need to be tweaked at the
application level.
