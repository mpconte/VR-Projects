<h1>Environment File Format</h1>
<p>Environments describe the geometry of the walls of the virtual environment 
and where they are located (in terms of graphics displays, hosts, etc.).
The structures are defined in detail in the
<a href="../ref/ve_env.h.html">ve_env.h</a>
module of the <a href="../ref/index.html">VE API Reference Documentation</a>.
The basic syntax of the file is based around a list syntax described
in the <a href="../ref/ve_tlist.h.html">ve_tlist.h</a> module.
<p>An environment file is comprised of a number of statements.
The following statements are valid:
<dl>
<dt><b>name</b> <i>string</i></dt>
<dd>Names the environment.  This is purely for informational purposes.</dd>
<dt><b>desc</b> <i>string</i></dt>
<dd>A description of the environment.  This is purely for informational
purposes.</dd>
<dt><b>option</b> <i>name</i> <i>value</i></dt>
<dd>Sets environment options.  Meaningful options will vary between
implementations.  Options set at this level are defaults for everything
else set in this environment file.</dd>
<dt><b>wall</b> <i>name</i> <b>{</b><i>walldata</i> ... <b>}</b></dt>
<dd>A wall declaration.  A wall must have a name followed by a set of
lines describing the information for the wall.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Wall Statements</h2>
The following statements can be used in describing a wall:
<dl>
<dt><b>option</b> <i>name</i> <i>value</i></dt>
<dd>The same as the option statement at the environment level, but an
option here will be the default for any window that belongs to this wall,
overriding any option of the same name at the environment level.</dd>
<dt><b>loc</b> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> <i>z</i></dt>
<dt><b>dir</b> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> <i>z</i></dt>
<dt><b>up</b> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> <i>z</i></dt>
<dd>A frame indicating the orientation of the wall relative to the origin
of the environment.  This information indicates what will be shown on this
wall.  See the <a href="../ref/ve_env.h.html">ve_env.h</a> module for more
information on the VeFrame structure.  All values are real numbers.  The
<i>loc</i> value determines the centre of the screen in space.  The
<i>dir</i> value indicates the normal of the screen pointing towards
the viewer.  The <i>up</i> value indicates the vertical axis of the
screen.  Common practice is to use metres for units.
</dd>
<dt><b>size</b> <i>width</i> <i>height</i></dt>
<dd>The size of the screen.  Common practice is to use metres for units.</dd>
<dt><b>base</b> (<b>origin</b>|<b>eye</b>)</dt>
<dd>Indicates whether this wall is fixed (i.e. located
relative to the origin of the environment) or attached to the user
(i.e. located relative to the user's default eye).  In physical
terms, the "default eye" is located between the user's two eyes
(or in the user's eye if your user is a cyclops).  Caves have walls
that use the origin as their base and head-mounted displays have
walls that use the default eye as their base.  If omitted, then
the default is <b>origin</b>.</dd>
<dt><b>window</b> <i>name</i> <b>{</b><i>windowdata</i> ... <b>}</b></dt>
<dd>A window declaration.  A wall may have any number of windows.  A window
must be named.
</dl>

<h2>Window Statements</h2>
The following statements can be used in describing a window:
<dl>
<dt><b>option</b> <i>name</i> <i>value</i></dt>
<dd>The same as the option statement at the environment and wall levels, but an
option here will be the default for this window,
overriding any option of the same name at the environment or wall level.</dd>
<dt><b>display</b> <i>name</i></dt>
<dd>A name for the display on which the output of the wall.  Names are
platform-dependent, but the name "default" is always supported and should
be a sane choice on all platforms.  On X-based platforms (e.g. GLX
implementation) this string is the X display on which to open this window.
Setting a display of "default" should be equivalent to omitting the display
statement entirely.
</dd>
<dt><b>geometry</b> <i>w</i>x<i>h</i>(+|-)<i>x</i>(+|-)<i>y</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the location of this window on the display.  All values are
in pixels.  <i>w</i> and <i>h</i> give the on-screen height and width of the
window in pixels.  <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> give the distance to the nearest 
corner of the window from the upper-left corner of the screen, 
if the character in front
of the distances is '+'.  If the character in front of either distance is '-' 
then
the distance is measured from the opposite side (e.g. if the character in
front of <i>x</i> is '-', then the distance is measured from the right
side of the screen to the nearest corner of the window).
</dd>
<dt><b>err</b> <i>w_err</i> <i>h_err</i></dt>
<dd>An error value for the dimensions of the screen in real space.  These
values are effectively added to the stated width and height of the window
for all calculations.  These values are provided separately so that the
measured size of the window can be entered in the <b>size</b> statement
and then this statement can be used as a fine adjustment.
If omitted, these values both default to 0.0.
</dd>
<dt><b>offset</b> <i>x_err</i> <i>y_err</i></dt>
<dd>Similar to the <b>err</b> statement, except that this statement is
a fine adjustment for centre of the window in the plane of the wall.
It is also used for calibration.  If omitted, these values both default to
0.0.
</dd>
<dt><b>eye</b> <i>eyedisp</i></dt>
<dd>Determines what eye displacement should be used when rendering
this window.  The following values are known:
      <dl>
      <dt><b>mono</b></dt>
      <dd>Render the window with no eye displacement.  This is the
      default if no eye statement is specified.</dd>
      <dt><b>left</b></dt>
      <dd>Render the window with displacement for the left eye.</dd>
      <dt><b>right</b></dt>
      <dd>Render the window with displacement for the right eye.</dd>
      <dt><b>stereo</b></dt>
      <dd>Where supported, render a stereoscopic image.  Platforms
      that do not support this option will emit a warning when the
      problem is first encountered and then treat this window as
      though it were labelled <b>VE_WIN_MONO</b></dd>
      </dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following is a simple example:
<pre>
        name cave-2
        desc "A two-screen stereoscopic cave for testing.
              One wall has a second monoscopic window for monitoring 
              what is going on in the cave."
        option noborder 1
        wall front {

                up 0.0 1.0 0.0
                dir 0.0 0.0 -1.0
                size 1.0 1.0
                window front1 {
                        display default
                        geometry 600x600+0+0
                        err -0.014 0.005
                        eye stereo
                }
                window monitor {
                        # this window is for watching 
                        # what's going on
                        display monitor:0
                        geometry 1024x768+0+0
                        # this option overrides the default at
                        # the top level
                        eye mono
                }
        }
        wall right {

                window right1 {
                        display default
                        geometry 600x600+600+0
                        eye stereo
                }
        }
