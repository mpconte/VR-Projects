<h1>File: ve_thread_sys.h</h1>


<p>
    <p>
    The ve_thread_sys.h include file defines the platform-specific
    thread types.  These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>VeThread</b></li> - a thread
    <li><b>VeThrMutex</b></li> - a mutex
    <li><b>VeThrCond</b></li> - a condition variable
    <li><b>VeThrBarrier</b></li> - an n-thread barrier
    </ul>
    <p>All types should be treated as though they were opaque struct-like 
    types.
    They are passed to/from function calls by reference, but applications
    should never assume anything about the members of the structures (or
    even that they actually are structures).  It should be assumed that
    these objects are not usable unless they have been initialized with
    a VE call as described in the thread interface.</p>
    <p>This header file is part of an abstraction layer so that threads
    can be defined in a relatively cross-platform manner to making porting
    of the entire VE library easier.</p>
