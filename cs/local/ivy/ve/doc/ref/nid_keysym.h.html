<p>
    This module defines keycodes for keyboard devices.  NID keyboards
    should return these keycodes when the appropriate keys are pressed.
    They are all defined as macros, based upon the X11 keysym definitions.
    All macros begin with the <code>NIDK_</code> prefix.  See the header
    file for the list of macros.
