<h2 align="center">Concepts</h2>

The VE library is largely concerned with managing an <i>environment</i>. 
An environment is a physical space in the real world in which the user
is typically located.  This environment interfaces with the virtual
world by means of input devices and walls/windows.  <i>Walls</i> are
portals in the virtual world which are rendered in the real world as 
<i>windows</i>. 
For example, a wall's centre may have a particular location in the virtual
world and is oriented so that its normal is aligned with the z-axis and
"up" is considered to be in the direction of the positive y-axis. 
The image that would be generated if the virtual world were projected onto
that wall would be displayed in a window, which is a real output device
- e.g. a particular area on an X display.  A window can be thought
of as the output of a wall.

<p>There are several co-ordinate systems or <i>spaces</i>.  We need
to consider.  There is <i>world space</i> which is the co-ordinate
system of the virtual world. There is <i>environment space</i> which is
the physical real-world co-ordinate system of the virutal environment. 
It is in this system that screens, input devices, the user, etc. are located. 
We may at times discuss <i>eye space</i> which is the view of the world
from the perspective of the camera or viewer and <i>screen space</i> which
is the view of the world from the perspective of the screen onto which
the image is rendered.  In discussing spaces, we refer to their base
as a frame.  A <i>frame</i> relates one space to another.  The
frame of the environment is expressed in world space co-ordinates, and
thus relates the environment to the world.  The frame of the eye is
expressed in environment space co-ordinates and thus relates the eye to
the environment.  Note that we must combine frames in order to relate
the eye to the world - frames are unique to a relation between two co-ordinate
spaces, not to a paritcular space.
<p>By altering the environment's frame, you can move the envrionment through
the virtual world.  This is typically how one would simulate vehicle
motion - i.e. motion independent of the user's movements within the environment. 
An eye frame typically represents the user's location within the environment. 
This information is critical to generating the correct projections of the
world on the walls.
<p>A frame is defined as a set of three vectors:  <i>loc</i>, which
is the origin of the space, <i>dir</i>, which is a vector parallel to the negative
z-axis of the space, and <i>up</i>, which is a vector parallel to the positive
y-axis of the space.
