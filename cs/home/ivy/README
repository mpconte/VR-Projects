This is the main account for the virtual environment project at york.
The current working name (IVY) is for "Immersive Virtual ... at York".
It is just a working name.  A quick overview of the top-level directory:

bin  - support programs and scripts.  Demos are typically not kept here
       as they require other files.

dist - contains distributions of software from the IVY project.  This
       is for internal storage only.  At this time, this software should
       not be redistributed.

doc - local documentation for the IVY project.

misc - other files that don't belong above - e.g. the .cmb files we use
       for the Onyx2.

progs - active programs for the virtual environment.  If you are looking for
        demos to run, this is the place to look.

src - unpacked and built core software.  This contains the current working
      version of the VE library.
