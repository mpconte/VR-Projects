<p>
    <p>The ve_thread module provides an abstract interface for working
    with threads.  Much of this is targetted towards the library itself
    but can also be used by applications based upon the library.</p>
    <p>Most of the types used in this module should be considered
    opaque and should only be generated by calls to the library.
    The <i>ve_thread_sys</i> module has more on the cross-platform nature
    of the thread support.</p>
    <p>Since this module is meant as support to the rest of the library,
    any reference to the "application" in the documentation can be taken
    to mean any code, program, or library which calls this module.  The
    "current thread" refers to the thread that calls the given function.</p>

<p>
<a name="function_veThrBarrierCreate"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThrBarrierCreate</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
VeThrBarrier *veThrBarrierCreate(int size);</pre>    Creates a barrier.  A barrier will stop all threads as they enter the 
    barrier and will only let them go once a particular number of threads
    have arrived.
    
<p><b>size</b> - 
    The number of threads that must arrive in the barrier before the
    threads are released.  This number is fixed for a given barrier -
    it cannot be changed once the barrier is created.

<p><i>Returns:</i> 
    A pointer to a newly allocated barrier.  This barrier must be
    destroyed with <code>veThrBarrierDestroy()</code> in order to free
    the memory associated with the barrier.
 
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="function_veThrBarrierDestroy"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThrBarrierDestroy</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void veThrBarrierDestroy(VeThrBarrier *b);</pre>    Destroys a barrier and deallocates its associated resources.  It is up
    to the application to ensure that there are no threads in the barrier
    when it is destroyed.
    
<p><b>b</b> - 
    A pointer to the barrier to be destroyed.  This barrier must have
    been generated by a call to <code>veThrBarrierCreate()</code>.

</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="function_veThrBarrierEnter"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThrBarrierEnter</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void veThrBarrierEnter(VeThrBarrier *b);</pre>    Causes the current thread to enter the specified barrier.  Once the
    thread enters the barrier it will block until the barrier has filled
    with threads (determined by the barrier's size).  Once the barrier
    has filled, all threads in the barrier will be released.  This
    function does not return until the threads are released.

<p><b>b</b> - 
    A pointer to the barrier to enter.  This barrier must have been
    generated by a call to <code>veThrBarrierCreate()</code>.

</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="function_veThreadCreate"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThreadCreate</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
VeThread *veThreadCreate();</pre>    Creates a new thread object.  Note that the thread is not active
    until it has been initialized by a call to <code>veThreadInit</code>.
    
<p><i>Returns:</i> 
    A pointer to the newly created thread object.  This object must be
    disposed of by calling <code>veThreadDestroy</code> to release its
    associated resources.

</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="function_veThreadId"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThreadId</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
int veThreadId(void);</pre>    Attempts to determine a unique identifier for the current thread.
    This should only be used for debugging reporting - it may not
    work properly on all platforms.

<p><i>Returns:</i> 
    An integer identifying the current thread,if possible.

</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="function_veThreadInit"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThreadInit</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
int veThreadInit(VeThread *t, void *(*func)(void *), void *arg, int priority,
		 int flags);</pre>    <p>Initializes a thread.  After this call, the thread will begin to
    execute code starting at the specified function.  A priority may
    be specified - higher values indicate threads that run at a higher
    priority.</p>

<p><b>t</b> - 
    A pointer to the thread object to initialize.  If this value is 
    <code>NULL</code> then an anonymous thread will be created.  That is,
    the thread will exist and run, but there will be no <code>VeThread</code>
    structure attached to it.  Such a thread cannot be controlled via the 
    <code>VeThreadKill()</code> and <code>VeThreadWait()</code> calls.

<p><b>func</b> - 
    The function at which the thread will start execution.  Upon returning
    from this function, the thread will stop execution.  This function should
    take a single <code>void *</code> argument.

<p><b>arg</b> - 
    The argument which will be passed to the function <code>func</code>.
    
<p><b>priority</b> - 
    A non-negative priority to assign this thread.  Higher values indicate
    a higher priority.  If the specified priority exceeds system values,
    then the value will be clamped.  An implementation may choose to ignore
    specified thread priorities and run all threads at the same priority.
    Hence, this argument is purely advisory.

<p><b>flags</b> - 
    The bitwise-or of a number of possible option flags.  Currently, only
    the <code>VE_THR_KERNEL</code> flag is defined.  By default, the 
    thread system will
    tend towards creating user-level threads.  If <code>VE_THR_KERNEL</code> 
    is specified then the system will attempt to create a kernel-level thread.
    Kernel-level threads have more overhead associated
    with them, but tend to have better scheduling
    characteristics, particularly on multi-processor systems.  Kernel-level
    threads may not be supported on some platforms and may be the default
    on others.  Hence, this option is advisory, but every effort is made
    to honour it.

<a name="function_veThreadKill"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThreadKill</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void veThreadKill(VeThread *t);</pre>    Forcibly halts execution of a thread.  There are no guarantees
    that the thread has left its context in a meaningful state. 
    Any application which terminates a thread in this fashion should
    be prepared to clean up anything it leaves behind.  After returning

<a name="function_veThrCondCreate"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThrCondCreate</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
VeThrCond *veThrCondCreate();</pre>    <p>Creates a condition variable.  A condition variable is an object

<p><b>m</b> - 
    The mutex associated with this condition variable.  The current

<a name="function_veThrCondTimedWait"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThrCondTimedWait</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void veThrCondTimedWait(VeThrCond *c, VeThrMutex *m, long ms);</pre>    <p>Similar to <code>veThrCondWait</code> except that a time-limit
    is put upon how long the thread will wait on the given condition
    variable.  If the time-limit is reached before the event associated
    with the condition variable occurs, then the thread will be re-lock 
    the given mutex and return.</p>

<p><b>c</b> - 
    The condition variable to wait upon.

<p><b>m</b> - 
    The mutex associated with this condition variable.  The current
    thread must be holding this mutex.  The mutex will be unlocked
    while the thread is waiting and will be locked again once it
    finishes waiting.

<p><b>ms</b> - 
    The time-limit in milliseconds.  If this amount of time passes
    before the thread is woken up, then the thread will return as
    though it had been woken up.

<p>
<a name="function_veThrCondSignal"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThrCondSignal</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void veThrCondSignal(VeThrCond *c);</pre>    <p>Signals that the event associated with a condition variable
    has occurred.  Wakes up one thread that is waiting on the
    condition variable.  That thread will then attempt to re-lock its
    mutex and return from its corresponding "wait" function call.
    If no threads are waiting on this condition variable, then this
    call has no effect.</p>
    
<p><b>c</b> - 
    The condition variable on which to wake up threads.

<a name="function_veThrCondBcast"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThrCondBcast</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void veThrCondBcast(VeThrCond *c);</pre>    <p>Signals that the event associated with a condition variable
    has occurred.  Wakes up <i>all</i> threads that are waiting on the
    condition variable.
    If no threads are waiting on this condition variable, then this
    call has no effect.</p>
    
<p><b>c</b> - 
    The condition variable on which to wake up threads.

<p>
<a name="function_veThrInitDelayGate"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThrInitDelayGate</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void veThrInitDelayGate(void);</pre>    <p>Initializes the delay gate.  Must be called before anything enters
    the delay gate.

</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="function_veThrDelayGate"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThrDelayGate</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void veThrDelayGate(void);</pre>    <p>Provided for threads that may be created during program initialization
    but which should not run until later.  Any such thread should call this
    function.  This function will not return until the 
    <code>veThrReleaseDelayed()</code> function is called from elsewhere in
    the program.

</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="function_veThrReleaseDelayed"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThrReleaseDelayed</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void veThrReleaseDelayed(void);</pre>    <p>Allows threads that are waiting in the delay gate to continue.
    After this function is called, the gate is considered open and any
    further threads that call <code>veThrDelayGate()</code> will not
    be stopped.

</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="function_veThreadInitDelayed"></a><p><em>Function:</em> <b>veThreadInitDelayed</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
int veThreadInitDelayed(void *(*func)(void *), void *arg, 
			int priority, int flags);</pre>    <p>This has the same effect as veThreadInit, except that actual
    instantiation of the thread will be delayed until the delay gate
    has been opened (by a call to <code>veThrReleaseDelayed()</code>).
    This allows threads to be setup but not actually created until needed.
    This approach helps on platforms with unusual thread characteristics 
    (e.g. Linux) and helps stability with multiple-process renderers.</p>
    <p>In general, all device drivers should use this interface instead
    of the <code>veThrDelayGate()</code> call.</p>
    <p>If the delay gate has already been released then this call has
    the identical effect as a call to <code>veThreadInit()</code>.
    For the details of the effects of the arguments, see 
    <code>veThreadInit()</code>.  Note that there is no argument that
    allows you to retrieve the id of a delayed thread.
