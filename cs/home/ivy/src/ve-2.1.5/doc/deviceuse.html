<h1>Device Usage File Format</h1>
<p>This device usage file allows devices and filters to be specified
at run-time.  Devices are used via a "use" statement which has the
following format:</p>
<blockquote><b>use</b> <i>name</i> [<b>optional</b>]</blockquote>
The <i>name</i> value is the name of the device to use (the name
must exist in the device manifest).  If a device is not available
then the program will exit.  If you want a program to ignore a device
if it does not exist, then use the word "optional" at the end to
indicate that use of this device is optional.  If the program
can find the device, it will use it.  Otherwise, it will ignore it.
<p>Filters are specified as described in <a href="ref/ve_device.h.html#function_veDeviceParseFTableEntry">veDeviceParseFTableEntry()</a> except
that the word "filter" must be specified.
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following is a simple example:
<pre>
        #
        # This file list devices that are used at run-time, plus
        # filters
        #
        use keyboard
        use sidewinder
        use whoozit optional
        filter sidewinder.axis0 {
                # use this event for both x and y
                copy location.x
                rename location.y
        }
        filter sidewinder.button0 { rename exit }
        filter keyboard.Escape    { discard }
        filter keyboard.F1        { rename exit }
        filter sidewinder.button2 {
                # fake a valuator
                to_valuator expr=1.0*x min=0.0 max=1.0
                rename location.x
        }
        filter sidewinder.button3 {
                # fake a valuator
                to_valuator expr=1.0*x min=0.0 max=1.0
                rename location.y
        }
