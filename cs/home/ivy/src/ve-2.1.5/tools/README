This directory contains a number of tools that are part of VE and
its associated libraries:

nid_snoop
- queries a nid server for all devices and returns events as they occur.
  Useful for quick checks to see if a NID server is returning sane data.

nid_server
- a standalone NID server which requires no other libraries except for
  libnid and libveclock.  This is useful in cases where you do not want
  the entire VE library or you cannot have the entire VE library for
  some reason.  Unlike the ve_nid_server, this server does not use threads
  at all, meaning that it requires a different driver implementation for
  devices, but it is also potentially a lighter-weight program.

ve_nid_server
- a NID server that uses VE device drivers.  This is the preferred NID
  server as it allows a device to be supported both locally and remotely
  using a single implementation of a device driver.
