A set of filters for converting rotation representations: euler angles,
quaternions, matrices

angles are always vectors of size 3
quaternions are always vectors of size 4 [x,y,z,w] (vector, scalar)
matrices are always vectors of size 16 in column-major format a-la
OpenGL.

All filters take a single unnamed argument which is the name to use
as a new element name in <device>.<elem>.  If there is no "." in the
argument, then the string is treated as the new element name and the
name of the current device is used.  If no argument is specified then
the device and element name are left unchanged.

All filters accept the following named arguments:
angin=<rad|deg> - specifies the units for angle data coming in (default=rad)
angout=<rad|deg> - specifies the units for angle data coming out (default=rad)
- if the appropriate input/output is not in angles then that named argument
  is ignored

The filter names are:

ang_to_quat
ang_to_mtx
quat_to_ang
quat_to_mtx
mtx_to_ang
mtx_to_quat

There is also:

ang_to_ang

which normally does nothing, unless you specify angin/angout - you can
use it to convert angles from radians to degrees or vice-versa.
The ve_math module is used where possible to avoid duplicating code.
