Started with v2.1.2

v2.1.5 (bugfix)
        * bad memory free call in head-track filter fixed
	* fastrak driver revamped to support native timestamps
	  (specify "tmstamp 1" option in device config)
	* crash problem in fastrak driver fixed
	
v2.1.4 (bugfix)
	* ve_core now propogates NVIDIA OpenGL environment variables
	  to remote slaves (including __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK and
	  __GL_FSAA_MODE)
	* new fastrak driver can deal with bogus records returned
	  from tracker due to serial noise

v2.1.3
	* Added linuxmouse driver
	* Added fobg driver (provided by Lee Yan)
	* fastrak driver now supports multiple devices (modified by Lee Yan)
	* removed old grungy trivial example
	* "calibrate" program is now cluster-friendly and built by default
	* VeWallView structure now includes which stereo eye is being drawn
	  (new VE_EYE_MONO added for monoscopic windows)
	* some compiler warning clean-up
	* fix whitespace-elimination bug in device specs
	* added support for generic (i.e. non-API device functions)
          see veDeviceFunc()
	* support for "asynchronous" clients where we do not try to
	  synchronize rendering
	* forced update of screen on program initialization (avoid black
	  screen startup)
	* more MP bug/stability fixes
	* faster startup times for larger clusters
	* support for fragmenting MP packets to remote hosts to allow
	  larger message sizes
	* support for specifying accumulator buffer ("accum" option)
	* X screen-saver can be disabled with "nosaver" option in
          vei_glx implementation
	* New clock functions:  veClockHires(), veClockConvUnix(),
	  veClockConvTimeval(), veClockConvTimespec()
	* profiling support
		- to enable, set VE_PF to be the name of the file
	          to which profiling events are written
		- scripts in the util/ subdirectory will help to
		  extract some interesting bits of information from
		  the output (which is human-readable)
		- to be expanded in future versions

v2.1.2
	* Support for viewport calibration.  A viewport can now be set
	  per-window in the environment file.
	* Calibration reorganized and rewritten for future ease of extension.
	* Calibration program allows adjustment of viewport.
	* Debugging messages are less munged together in multi-threaded apps
	* Extraneous threads in slave-only processes removed
	* veQuatMult (ve_math.c) was wrong - fixed
	* added veRotMatrixToQuat (ve_math.c)
	* MP layer is now more robust, both locally and across the network
	* added gl_render_time, gl_frame_time to OpenGL stats
	* renamed glx_frame_rate stat to gl_frame_rate
	* swap group support can now be turned on/off at compile-time and
	  at run-time.  If turned off at compile-time, then no swap group
	  support will be compiled.  Off by default on Linux, on by default
	  elsewhere at compile-time.
	* Working "fastrak" driver merged.  Only tested with IS-900 so far,
	  but should only be using general fastrak command set.
	* headtrack filter more robust.
	* "busy-wait timer" implementation can be enabled/disabled at
	  run-time to work around coarse sleeping functions on various
	  platforms.  Enabled by default on Linux, disabled by default
	  elsewhere.
