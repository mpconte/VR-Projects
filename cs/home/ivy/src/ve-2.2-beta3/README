To build (on a supported system):

- make
	Builds everything.
	Runs autocfg script if necessary.

- make VEROOT=/path/to/install install
	Installs the VE files where you want them.

Quick VE 2.1 -> 2.2 porting tips:

- data file formats have changed (see examples)
- applications will need to be recompiled and ported (slightly)
- applications will need to at least:

	- remove includes of "vei_gl.h" and "vei_glx.h"
		(no longer used)
	- add explicit OpenGL includes (i.e. <GL/gl.h>) if not
	  already present
	- change "veiGlSetWindowCback" to "veRenderSetupCback"
	- change "veiGlSetDisplayCback" to "veRenderCback"
	- change "veiGlParseGeom" to "veParseGeom"
	- remove any code that uses "text-mode" or VeiGl* objects
	  (no longer present)
		- an alternative for "text-mode" will be available
	  	  at a later date
