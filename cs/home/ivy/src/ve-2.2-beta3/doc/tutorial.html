<h1>VE - A Quick and Dirty Tutorial</h1>
<hr />
<p><a href="index.html">Back to the index</a></p>

<p>As the title implies, this is meant to get you up and coding VE programs
as quickly as possible.  If you have worked with the GLUT library you will
find the general structure of VE programs familiar although the interface
is different in many ways.</p>

<h2>The Major Pieces</h2>
<p>The purpose of VE is to take care of the repetitive tasks for our 
virtual environments, as well as to provide an abstraction so that a
program need only be written once to then run in our cave, on the motion
platform, in an HMD, on a workstation, etc.  A VE program is made up
of the following pieces:</p>

<h3>The Environment File (env)</h3>
<p>An environment file describes what screens are being used, how they
are arranged in space, how they are accessed, their geometry and any
calibration information.  There is typically a single environment file
for any installation (cave, trike, motion platform, etc.).  This environment
file is read at run-time, so this information does not need to be compiled
into your program.</p>

<h3>The User Profile (profile)</h3>
<p>A user profile contains configuration information that is specific to
the user of the system.  Currently the most crucial information is the
stereo eye separation.  The format is general in that it can contain
other user-specific information in the future.  It is expected that in
the long run, each user will have a single profile.  For now, a default
is used.</p>

<h3>The Availble Device Manifest (manifest)</h3>
<p>The manifest describes all of the input devices that are potentially 
available in the system.  There is typically one for each installation or 
in some cases, one for all installations.  Listing a device in the manifest 
makes it possible for a device to be used by a program, but it is up to
the program to specify which of the available devices will actually be used.
The manifest helps to specify some information once (e.g. what port is
a device hooked up to, which host is a server running on, at what speed do
we talk to the head tracker, etc.) in one location.</p>

<h3>The Device Usage File (devices)</h3>
<p>Each program typically has one or more device usage files.  These
files describe explicitly what input devices to use and how to integrate
them into the program.  The device usage file allows you to remap incoming
events from various input devices so that you need not rebuild your program
for each new input device that you want to use.</p>

<h3>The Application</h3>
<p>In addition to the above data there actually needs to be a program to run.
The program will be largely concerned with two tasks:  rendering the geometry
and controlling the logic of the simulation.</p>

<h2>An Annotated Example Program</h2>

<p>The following is a simple annotated example.  The program simulates
a large cube with a different colour on each face that is rotating around
the origin.  The user can control which axes (x, y, or z) the cube is
rotating around; they can toggle the rotation around any one of the
axes on or off.  Initially the cube is rotating around the y axis.
The code here is complete except for many of the comments which have
been replaced with inline text instead.  This program can be found in the
VE distribution in the <code>examples/cube</code> directory. 
</p>

<p>Any VE program must include the appropriate header files.  There is
one that is critical:
<ul>
<li><code>ve.h</code> - This is the main VE header file.</li>
</ul>
In addition, any include files that are needed for any APIs that your
    program uses (e.g. OpenGL) must also be included.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h>

#include &lt;ve.h>
#include &lt;GL/gl.h>
#include &lt;GL/glu.h></pre>
</div>

<p>
We define some constants for the program.  <code>ROTSPEED</code> is the
speed in degrees/second that we want to turn.  <code>FRAME_INTERVAL</code>
is the minimum amount of time that will elapse between animating frames in
milliseconds.  The value defined here will turn out to be slightly more
than 60 frames/second.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
#define ROTSPEED 45.0
#define FRAME_INTERVAL (1000/60)</pre>
</div>

<p>
The following are the state variables for the program.  We're tracking
the rotation angle around each access and a flag indicating whether or
not we should increment the angle around each access.  The variables
      are grouped together into a single structure called <i>state</i>
      for convenience.  We will need to tell VE later on that these
      variables need to propagated to any rendering nodes that we use.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
struct {
  float ang[3];
  int rot[3];
} state = {
  { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 },
  { 0, 1, 0 }
};</pre>
</div>

<p>
The following are the declarations for the callback functions we will
be using.  We'll discuss them in greater detail when we define them
below.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
void setupwin(VeWindow *w);
void display(VeWindow *w, long tm, VeWallView *wv);
void update_angles(void *);
int axis_toggle(VeDeviceEvent *, void *);</pre>
</div>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {</pre>
</div>

<p>
Every VE program should start with a call to "veInit()".
This sets up basic structures and allows the library to parse and
process any command-line arguments.
After returning from veInit(), any arguments the library recognized
will have been removed.  Thus, if we so desired, we could check for
program-specific options at this point.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
  veInit(&amp;argc,argv);</pre>
</div>
  
<p>If we have specific needs for the framebuffer configuration that we
will be using, we need to let the library know at this point by
setting options.  Option names and values are strings.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
  veSetOption("depth","1");          /* request a depth buffer (Z-buffer) */
  veSetOption("doublebuffer","1");   /* request a double-buffered config */</pre>
</div>

<p>
Other recognized OpenGL/GLX-layer options are:
<ul>
<li><code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, 
<code>blue</code>, <code>alpha</code> - requests a specific minimum depth for 
       red, green, blue, and alpha components.  All buffers will have 
       bits for red, green, and blue, but not necessarily alpha.  If your
       program needs an alpha component in the frame-buffer you should include
<blockquote><code>veSetOption("alpha","1");</code></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
     Note that options can also be set via the command-line, e.g.
<blockquote><code>prog -ve_opt alpha 1</code></blockquote>
     but in general, requirements of the program should be hardcoded.
</p>

<p>
We need to setup two rendering callbacks - one for initializing a window
when it is created, and another for rendering a window (similar to a
GLUT display callback).
</p>
<div class="eg">
<pre>
  veRenderSetupCback(setupwin);
  veRenderCback(display);</pre>
</div>

<p>VE supports many different models of rendering.  There is 
<i>local</i> rendering where the actual rendering work takes place
in the same process as simulation.  In the <i>local</i> case we do not
need to worry about how to propagate information since we have it
already.  VE can also support <i>parallel</i> rendering where
the actual rendering takes place in separate processes on the same
host as the simulation, and <i>clustered</i> rendering where rendering
is split over several hosts.  The particular model can be chosen at
<i>run-time</i>.  Good programming practice means that we cannot
assume that our rendering code necessarily executes in the same
process as our simulation code.  All processes (whether for rendering
or simulation) initialize in the same way, so any information that is
read in from files or declared statically in variables will be
initialized in all processes.  However, for information that will
change as the program is running we need a method for propagating that
method to the other processes.
</p>

<p>VE provides a simple one-way shared-memory model for propagating
information.  The "shared-memory" part means that we designate a block
of memory as a <i>state variable</i> which VE then propagates as
needed to the rendering nodes.  The "one-way" part means that data is
copied from the simulation node to the rendering nodes, but not vice
versa.  However, keep in mind that there may be only one node in the
system - i.e. there is only one process which does all simulation and
rendering.</p>

<p>The following bit of code will defined our "state" structure as a
state variable.  After we call this, we can assume in our rendering
code that this variable is always up-to-date.  We need an identifier
in case we have multiple state variables.  The actual value of the
identifier is not important as long as it is consistent.  The
identifier, however, must be >= 0.</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
#define SV_ANGLES 0
  veMPAddStateVar(SV_ANGLES,&state,sizeof(state),VE_MP_AUTO);</p>
</div>

<p>Now we setup the input event callbacks.
In this case, any event with a device name "axis" (regardless of
element name) will be passed to the axis_toggle() function.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
  veDeviceAddCallback(axis_toggle,NULL,"axis");</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we setup a timer procedure.  This is a callback that will be called
once after the specified amount of time has elapsed.  We can
have the function repeatedly every 'n' seconds by registering
a new timer procedure in the callback itself (see the code for 
update_angles() below).  In this case, we will call the update_angles()
in "0" milliseconds, which means "as soon as possible".
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
  veAddTimerProc(0,update_angles,NULL);</pre>
</div>

<p>
It is generally a good idea to set the Z clip planes at this point.
There is only one set of global values.  This will likely be improved
in a later version of the library.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
  veSetZClip(0.1,10.0);</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once our initialization is complete, we enter VE's event loop and
let the library take over from here. 
veRun() should never return, but good form indicates we should
handle the unexpected as gracefully as possible.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
  veRun();
  return 0;
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
The window initialization callback.  This is called once for each window.
At this point, it is safe to make OpenGL calls.  It is generally used
to setup the OpenGL context.  Many VE programs will use multiple windows
and will not share OpenGL contexts.  Thus you should be sure to
define any lights, materials, textures, etc. in *every* window.
</p>
<p>
Calls to this callback are serialized - that is, there are no other threads
in the user program when this function is called.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
void setupwin(VeWindow *w) {
  glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
  glShadeModel(GL_FLAT);
}</pre>
</div>


<p>The following function is provided as a easy means to
draw the cube.  We will call it from our rendering callback.</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
void draw_cube(float f) {
  glBegin(GL_QUADS);

  glColor3f(1.0,0.0,0.0); /* red */
  glVertex3f(-f,-f,-f);
  glVertex3f(-f,-f,f);
  glVertex3f(f,-f,f);
  glVertex3f(f,-f,-f);
  
  glColor3f(0.0,1.0,0.0); /* green */
  glVertex3f(f,-f,f);
  glVertex3f(f,-f,-f);
  glVertex3f(f,f,-f);
  glVertex3f(f,f,f);

  glColor3f(0.0,0.0,1.0); /* blue */
  glVertex3f(f,f,-f);
  glVertex3f(f,f,f);
  glVertex3f(-f,f,f);
  glVertex3f(-f,f,-f);

  glColor3f(1.0,1.0,0.0); /* yellow */
  glVertex3f(-f,f,f);
  glVertex3f(-f,f,-f);
  glVertex3f(-f,-f,-f);
  glVertex3f(-f,-f,f);

  glColor3f(0.0,1.0,1.0); /* cyan */
  glVertex3f(-f,-f,-f);
  glVertex3f(f,-f,-f);
  glVertex3f(f,f,-f);
  glVertex3f(-f,f,-f);

  glColor3f(1.0,0.0,1.0); /* magenta */
  glVertex3f(-f,-f,f);
  glVertex3f(f,-f,f);
  glVertex3f(f,f,f);
  glVertex3f(-f,f,f);

  glEnd();
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
The GL rendering callback.  This is called once for each window in each
frame that is rendered.  Note that these callbacks may be called in
parallel - that is, it is possible for multiple threads to be executing
this code at once.

You should not initialize the projection or modelview matrices - VE
sets these up for you.  You can push/pop/multiply the existing matrices
as you normally would, or read the existing matrices to help in culling.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
void display(VeWindow *w, long tm, VeWallView *wv) {
  glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT|GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
  glMatrixMode(GL_VIEWING);
  glPushMatrix();
  /* rotate */
  glRotatef(state.ang[0],1.0,0.0,0.0);
  glRotatef(state.ang[1],0.0,1.0,0.0);
  glRotatef(state.ang[2],0.0,0.0,1.0);
  /* draw the cube */
  draw_cube(5.0);
  glPopMatrix();
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
update_angles() is our timer callback, and we effectively use it as
an animation loop.  Note that since our state changes in update_angles,
we'll also push data out to our slaves.  Note that the VE will only try
to redraw the screen if it has a reason to - either because the
operating system tells VE that the screen needs redrawing, or because
the application tells VE that the screen needs redrawing.  It is
important to call <code>vePostRedisplay()</code> from timer or event
handlers so that VE knows to redraw the screen.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
void update_angles(void *v) {
  static long last_time = -1;
  long now;
  float tm;

  if (last_time &lt; 0) {
    /* this is our first call - store the current value of the clock,
       so we can measure the real interval that we are being called on. */
    last_time = veClock();
  } else {
    /* update any angles that need updating */
    now = veClock();
    /* calculate elapsed time */
    tm = (now-last_time)*1.0e-3;

    for (k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
      if (state.rot[k]) {
        state.ang[k] += ROTSPEED*tm;
        if (state.ang[k] > 360.0)
          state.ang[k] -= 360.0;
      }
    }
    /* did we actually change anything? */
    if (state.rot[0] || state.rot[1] || state.rot[2]) {
      /* changes will be pushed out to the slaves automatically
         when the frame is redrawn */
      /* let the library know that the screen should be redrawn */
      vePostRedisplay();
    }
    /* save the current value of the clock */
    last_time = now;
  }</pre>
</div>

<p>
  Since update_angles() is called as a timer procedure, it is only
  called once and then the library (deliberately) forgets about it.
  If we want to use it as an animation loop, we need to keep requeueing
  it, with an appropriate delay.  The delay is in milliseconds, and
  is defined using the FRAME_INTERVAL macro (see the top of the code).
  Increasing the value of FRAME_INTERVAL makes for slower updates.
  Decreasing the value of FRAME_INTERVAL makes for faster updates.
  Note that the speed of the animation is bounded by how fast the 
  screen can actually be rendered.
</p>
<p>
   As a matter of good practice, we will add the timer procedure again
  with the same argument it was called with (v).  In this particular
  program, this value is always NULL, but again we are protecting against
  future modifications.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
  veAddTimerProc(FRAME_INTERVAL,update_angles,v);
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
We handle incoming device events in the axis_toggle() callback
that we setup earlier.  We'll use these events to update which
angles to rotate around.
Note that we do not need to push this data out to the slaves - the
processing which determines the new value of the angles is done on
the master.
</p>
<p>
"arg" is an optional argument that is supplied by the program and
is not derived from the event (second argument to veDeviceAddCallback).
In this case, we are not using it (it will always be NULL).
</p>
<p>
An event callback should always return 0.  Future support may allow
control of how further processing is done through return codes.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
int axis_toggle(VeDeviceEvent *e, void *arg) {
  /* ignore everything except for:
     - switch or keyboard events that are "down" (i.e. state is non-zero)
     - trigger events
  */
  if (VE_EVENT_TYPE(e) != VE_ELEM_TRIGGER &amp;&amp;
      !(VE_EVENT_TYPE(e) == VE_ELEM_SWITCH &amp;&amp; 
        VE_EVENT_SWITCH(e)->state) &amp;&amp;
      !(VE_EVENT_TYPE(e) == VE_ELEM_KEYBOARD &amp;&amp; 
        VE_EVENT_KEYBOARD(e)->state)) {
    return 0;
  }
  
  /* The event indicates that we should do something.  Based upon
     the element name in the event, toggle the various axis flags.
   */
  if (e->elem) {
    if (strcmp(e->elem,"x") == 0)
      x_rot = !x_rot;
    else if (strcmp(e->elem,"y") == 0)
      y_rot = !y_rot;
    else if (strcmp(e->elem,"z") == 0)
      z_rot = !z_rot;
  }

  return 0;
}</pre>
</div>

<h2>Compiling and Running The Program</h2>
<p>It is generally a good idea to set the <code>VEROOT</code> environment
variable when compiling or running VE programs.  When compiling, it makes
it easier to point the compiler and the include files and libraries, and
when running tells the library where to locate default configuration files
and device drivers.</p>
<p>The current working version of VE is installed in
/cs/home/ivy/ve-2.2 on our Linux systems.
If you are using csh or tcsh,
then you would set the path as:</p>
<div class="eg">
<blockquote><code>setenv VEROOT /cs/home/ivy/ve-2.2</code></blockquote>
</div>
<p>
In sh or bash, this would be:
</p>
<div class="eg">
<blockquote><code>VEROOT=/cs/home/ivy/ve-2.2 ; export VEROOT</code></blockquote>
</div>
<p>
The rest of these instructions assume that you have set this variable.
</p>
<h3>Compiling</h3>
<p>Assuming that the above program has been saved in a file called <code>cube.c</code> compile it as follows:</p>
<div class="eg">
<blockquote><code>cc -I$VEROOT/include -o cube cube.c -L$VEROOT/lib -Wl,-rpath,$VEROOT/lib -lve -lGL</code></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Let's look at what's going on in this compile command:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>-I$VEROOT/include</b> - points the compiler to where the VE include
                files are installed (assuming you set VEROOT appropriately
                as described above)</li>
<li><b>-L$VEROOT/lib</b> - points the compiler to where the VE libraries
                are installed</li>
<li><b>-Wl,-rpath,$VEROOT/lib</b> - the VE libraries are shared objects by
                default which means that they are loaded at run-time, not
                at link-time.  This means that the binary program you create
                must be able to find the shared objects at run-time.  This
                complex little option passes the right argument to the linker
                so that the binary knows to look in "$VEROOT/lib" for shared
                objects when it is executed.</li>
<li><b>-lve</b> - this is the main VE library</li>
<li><b>-lGL</b> - the OpenGL library - we need to link against library
that we explicitly use in our program</li>
</ul>

<h3>Running</h3>
<p>If VE has been setup properly, you should just be able to execute the
program:</p>
<div class="eg"><blockquote><code>./cube</code></blockquote></div>
<p>With the defaults, you should get a single window showing the cube from
the inside rotating around the y axis.  If you encounter an error then
one or more configuration files may be missing or incorrect.</p>
<p>When you run a VE program without any options, it searches for default
configuration files in the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>environment file
<ul>
<li>./default.env</li>
<li>$VEROOT/env/default.env</li>
<li>$VEROOT/default.env</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>profile
<ul>
<li>./default.pro</li>
<li>$VEROOT/profile/default.pro</li>
<li>$VEROOT/default.pro</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>available device manifest
<ul>
<li>./manifest</li>
<li>$VEROOT/manifest/manifest</li>
<li>$VEROOT/manifest</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>devices to use
<ul>
<li>./devices</li>
<li>$VEROOT/devices/devices</li>
<li>$VEROOT/devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use a different file other than the default, you can
use either an environment variable or command-line option to set a different
file name:</p>
<table align="center" border="3">
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Env Var</th><th>Cmd Line Opt</th></tr>
<tr><td>environment</td><td>VEENV</td><td>-ve_env</td></tr>
<tr><td>profile</td><td>VEPROFILE</td><td>-ve_profile</td></tr>
<tr><td>manifest</td><td>VEMANIFEST</td><td>-ve_manifest</td></tr>
<tr><td>devices</td><td>VEDEVICES</td><td>-ve_devices</td></tr>
</table>
<p>If you override any of the default file names, (command-line options
take precedence over environment variables) then the new name is used instead.
If the new name is not absolute (i.e. it does not begin with "/") then the
same locations in $VEROOT are searched.  For example, if you specified the
name "foo.env" as the environment, the library would search "./foo.env",
"$VEROOT/env/foo.env", and "$VEROOT/foo.env".</p>

<h2>Controlling Input Devices</h2>
<p>Input devices can be controlled and mapped at run-time using
a scripting language called "BlueScript".  More information is
given elsewhere in the VE documentation on the scripting language.</p>

<p>The program compiles and runs, but we would like to be able to control
it.  In the same directory as the "cube.c" file, there is also a file called
"devices" which contains a sample set of event mappings for the cube program.
If you copied that file to same directory where you ran the program, then
input devices were mapped for you already, even if you were not aware.</p>
<p>
The specifics
of the devices (type, how to connect to them, etc.) are located in
the manifest file.  The model is that there is typically a single
manifest for an installation and then a devices file for each particular
program describing what devices to use and how to use them.  The following
are some examples of how a devices file may be constructed for the cube
program.</p>

<p>Every device that you want to the program to use, must be explicitly
used in the "devices" file:</p>
<div class="eg">
<pre>
# We'll use the "keyboard" device for input.
use keyboard</pre>
</div>

<p>We can also specify <i>override</i> options for a device at the
same time that we use it.  These are options that are in addition to
the options specified in the manifest.  Of particular interest at this
point is the <i>optional</i> option.  If specified, then it indicates
that it is okay for this device to be inaccessible.  If a device
is used but not marked as optional and is not available when the
program starts, then the program will fail with an error message.
The following
example uses the device called "joystick", but notes that it is optional.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
use joystick {
        optional 1
}</pre>
</div>

<p>Events are identified by names which have two parts - a "device"
and an "element" (an "element" is a part of a device).  For example,
a joystick may be a device with several buttons, each one an element.</p>

<p>For our cube program, meaningful event names are "axis.x", "axis.y", 
and "axis.z".
But these are not the names that the "keyboard" device will generate.  We use
filters to modify incoming events.  Filters are put together in chains
guarded by a specification.  During processing, an incoming event is
compared to the specification at the beginning of each chain.  If it
matches, then the event is passed through all the filters in the chain.
</p>

<p>In the following examples, the event is represented by an object,
a reference to which is stored in the variable <i>e</i>.  We access
the value of this variable using the '$' symbol.</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
# Apply a filter to the "x" key so that it toggles the x axis.
# The built-in filter "rename" allows us to change the name of an event.
filter keyboard.x {
        $e rename axis.x
}

# Similary for y and z
filter keyboard.y {
        $e rename axis.y
}

filter keyboard.z {
        $e rename axis.z
}</pre>
</div>

<p>Note that if we wanted to, we could achieve all of the above with
just:
<blockquote><code>filter keyboard { $e rename axis }</code></blockquote>
which would rename the "device" part of an events.  However,
this would rename all incoming keyboard events to "axis" events,
which would make the following filter useless.
</p>

<p>We should also setup some way for use to exit the program.
The scripting language includes a command called "exit" which does
this for us.</p>
<div class="eg">
<pre>
filter keyboard.Escape { exit }</pre>
</div>

<p>We can change the processing of an event by returning a
specific value from the handler.
<ul>
<li><b>discard</b> - throw away this event (abort all processing)</li>
<li><b>deliver</b> - stop processing this event and deliver it to the application
               (i.e. call the callback if there is one)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
# Throw away any event from the 'j' key
filter keyboard.j {
        return discard
}</pre>

<p>
We can also generate new events, in this case, using "copy".  "copy"
is a member function of an event that returns a new event.  Note that
the new event is not pushed onto the queue until we *explicitly* push it.
We do this with the "push" command.  This allows you to change the event
before pushing it.  Pushing an event pushes a *copy* of the event so we
only need to create one copy to work with locally to generate multiple
events.
</p>
<p>
The original event is not affected by a copy.  A copied event is processed
as soon as processing for the current event finishes, so it is possible
to enter into an infinite loop with copies (e.g. copy creates an event
that, when filtered, also creates an event, etc.).
In this case, we'll use it for a key 'a' that will toggle all axes at
once.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
filter keyboard.a {
        # create a copy to work with locally
        set e2 [$e copy]
        $e2 rename axis.x
        # push it
        $e2 push
        # once pushed, we can change our event
        # without affecting the one on the queue
        $e2 rename axis.y
        $e2 push
        # Notice that our last step is a rename rather than a copy.
        # If we don't do this then we should discard this event or
        # otherwise be prepared for it to be processed as "keyboard.a"
        $e rename axis.z
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
Since pushes push copies of events, we do not need to copy
to do the above.  Let's do it without a copy and bind that
to button 'b'.
</p>
<div class="eg">
<pre>
filter keyboard.b {
        $e rename axis.x
        $e push
        $e rename axis.y
        $e push
        $e rename axis.z
        # do not push - let it process normally
}</pre>
</div>


<p>
Sometimes we want to change the type of an event to match our
specs.  Changing the "type" field of an event explicitly changes it to
a new type.  This will perform a "default" conversion which may or may
not be what we want.  To have more control over conversion we can use
built-in BlueScript functionality.
</p>
<p>
In this case, assuming that the joystick has an "axis0" that runs
from -1.0 to 1.0, we'll mimic a switch down event when the value is
greater "0.5".
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
filter joystick.axis0 {
        if { [$e type] == "valuator" } {
                # change it to a switch
                echo "value is [$e value]"
                if { [$e value] >= 0.5 } {
                        set state 1
                } else {
                        set state 0
                }
                $e type switch
                $e state $state
                # rename it to something more useful
                $e rename axis.x
        }
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
A handy built-in filter is "dump" which will print out any event
that is passed to it.  It is handy for determining what events are
really being delivered to your program.
</p>

<div class="eg">
<pre>
filter *.* {
        dump
}</pre>
</div>
