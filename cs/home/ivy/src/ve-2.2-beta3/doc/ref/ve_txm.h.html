    This module provides a slightly simpler wrapper around the
    TXM (Texture Manager) library.  The TXM library has now been
    integrated into VE.  As such, some aspects are simpler (e.g.
    VE works out what renderer driver is needed).  The raw "txm"
    functions are still available, but for simplicitly, the following
    wrappers are provided which assume the presence of a single manager.
