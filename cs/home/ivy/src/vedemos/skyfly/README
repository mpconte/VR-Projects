A port of the long-live oft-mangled SGI skyfly demo.  Originally written
for the early SkyWriter multiprocessor systems, ported to GLUT, from
which it was stolen for this port.  A lot of code has been culled or
disabled.  Also has sounds for shots and explosions.

Note that this program only works on the Onyx, or other single-process
environments - as it is, it will not
work on multi-node or multi-process VE environments - there is no MP
support.  I don't recommend trying to add the MP support in - this is
very old, very messy code which has been ported in every direction
imaginable.  If you really think it's worth porting, consider rewriting
it.
